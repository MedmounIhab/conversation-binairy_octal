# conversation-binairy_octale
a pragramme that converts numbers inputed by users from the binairy system to octal system without passing throught the decimal system
it follows this steps :
1/-it makes sure that the user inputed a binairy number, if the user input a non_binairy number the programme will ask him to reinput a nombre; the process repeats till the user input a binairy number (that does mean there won't be any conversation unless user follow the rules of inputing).
2/-it convert a binairy number using a special method which is described in this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxmarqiqUdM.
3/-it output the result at the end as an octal number.
